# Leelgo: the Unsearch Engine

Leelgo makes your life harder by helping you find **NOTHING**, you read that right: **NOTHING**, is just unbelievable how useless is this page.

Out of joke this is the first page I made in this Year, and it showcases the skills that I actually had develop in the last year (by basically using 1 hour per month to learn programming), I made this in a total of 3 hours (I guess) and have these features:

- SASS StylesSheet with a (defiantly improvable) Responsive design for the page

- A call to action to **DO NOTHING** than waste your time, sending a pop-up message as the response to the action, using vanilla JS to make the pop-up appear, with a *Random* Quote every time you use it

- Simple Google-like layout, easy to imitate

- Markdown file that have of had read already and more below

- Multiple Pages with quite uninteresting info

- Multiple Languajes Support (English, Spanish, Portuguese)

## Possible features
