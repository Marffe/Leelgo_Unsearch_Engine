# Leelgo: the Unsearch Engine

Leelgo makes your life harder by helping you find **NOTHING**, you read that right: **NOTHING**, is just unbelievable how useless is this page.

Out of joke this is the first page I made in this Year, and it showcases the skills that I actually had develop in the last year (by basically using 1 hour per month to learn programming), I made this in a total of 3 hours (I guess) and have these features:

- SASS StylesSheet with a (defiantly improvable) Responsive design for the page

- A call to action to **DO NOTHING** than waste your time, sending a pop-up message as the response to the action, using vanilla JS to make the pop-up appear

- Simple Google-like layout, easy to imitate

- Markdown file that have of had read already and more below

## Possible features

This page still having a lot of potential to by even **MORE USELESS** and can be a good practice for me me by adding these features I think when I was writing this part

- Make the FAQ, Terms and Policies and Credits send you to a page with info related to each one

- Make the contact link do exactly what is name means: links you to another page

- Force the user to waste even more time by force them to write something to make the pop-up appears

- Improve the Responsive design

- Adding Language support

- Dark mode of course
